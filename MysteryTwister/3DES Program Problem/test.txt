S. Kumar, C. Paar, J. Pelzl, G. Pfeiffer, A. Rupp, M. Schimmler, "How to Break DES for Euro 8,980". 
2nd Workshop on Special-purpose Hardware for Attacking Cryptographic Systems — SHARCS 2006, Cologne, Germany, April 3–4, 2006.

Abstract:

Cryptanalysis of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers is computationally extremely demanding. Since the security parameters of almost all practical crypto algorithms are chosen such that attacks with conventional computers are computationally infeasible, the only promising way to tackle existing ciphers (in the absence of mathematical breakthroughs) is to build special-purpose hardware. Dedicating those machines to the task of cryptanalysis holds the promise of a dramatically improved cost-performance ratio so that breaking of commercial ciphers comes within reach.

This contribution describes the design and realization of the reprogrammable machine COPACOBANA (Cost-Optimized Parallel Code Breaker), which is optimized for running cryptanalytical algorithms. The primary design goal was to produce a re-programmable low-cost design for less than BC 10,000 which is applicable for attacking the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in less than nine days.

It will be shown that the architecture outperforms conventional computers by several orders of magnitude. Fully configured, COPACOBANA hosts 120 low-cost FPGAs and is able to perform an exhaustive key search of DES at a rate of more than 235 keys per second, yielding an average search time of less than nine days. For this, we used the high-speed DES engine design of the Universite Catholique de Louvain's Crypto Group.

We provide a real-world example by giving an estimate of an attack with COPACOBANA against a formerly popular encryption tool (Norton Diskreet). Due to a cryptographical weak key derivation function it can be broken in very little time by applying a smart key search. As a further application, COPACOBANA can also be used to attack machine readable travel documents (ePass).

COPACOBANA is suitable for computational problems which are parallelizable and have low communication requirements. The hardware can be used, e.g., to attack elliptic curve cryptosystems and to factor numbers. COPACOBANA is intended to, but not necessarily restricted to solving problems related to cryptanalysis.

Cryptanalysis of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers is computationally extremely demanding. Since the security parameters of almost all practical crypto algorithms are chosen such that attacks with conventional computers are computationally infeasible, the only promising way to tackle existing ciphers (in the absence of mathematical breakthroughs) is to build special-purpose hardware. Dedicating those machines to the task of cryptanalysis holds the promise of a dramatically improved cost-performance ratio so that breaking of commercial ciphers comes within reach.

This contribution describes the design and realization of the reprogrammable machine COPACOBANA (Cost-Optimized Parallel Code Breaker), which is optimized for running cryptanalytical algorithms. The primary design goal was to produce a re-programmable low-cost design for less than BC 10,000 which is applicable for attacking the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in less than nine days.

It will be shown that the architecture outperforms conventional computers by several orders of magnitude. Fully configured, COPACOBANA hosts 120 low-cost FPGAs and is able to perform an exhaustive key search of DES at a rate of more than 235 keys per second, yielding an average search time of less than nine days. For this, we used the high-speed DES engine design of the Universite Catholique de Louvain's Crypto Group.

We provide a real-world example by giving an estimate of an attack with COPACOBANA against a formerly popular encryption tool (Norton Diskreet). Due to a cryptographical weak key derivation function it can be broken in very little time by applying a smart key search. As a further application, COPACOBANA can also be used to attack machine readable travel documents (ePass).

COPACOBANA is suitable for computational problems which are parallelizable and have low communication requirements. The hardware can be used, e.g., to attack elliptic curve cryptosystems and to factor numbers. COPACOBANA is intended to, but not necessarily restricted to solving problems related to cryptanalysis.

2nd Workshop on Special-purpose Hardware for Attacking Cryptographic Systems — SHARCS 2006, Cologne, Germany, April 3–4, 2006.

Abstract:

Cryptanalysis of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers is computationally extremely demanding. Since the security parameters of almost all practical crypto algorithms are chosen such that attacks with conventional computers are computationally infeasible, the only promising way to tackle existing ciphers (in the absence of mathematical breakthroughs) is to build special-purpose hardware. Dedicating those machines to the task of cryptanalysis holds the promise of a dramatically improved cost-performance ratio so that breaking of commercial ciphers comes within reach.

This contribution describes the design and realization of the reprogrammable machine COPACOBANA (Cost-Optimized Parallel Code Breaker), which is optimized for running cryptanalytical algorithms. The primary design goal was to produce a re-programmable low-cost design for less than BC 10,000 which is applicable for attacking the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in less than nine days.

It will be shown that the architecture outperforms conventional computers by several orders of magnitude. Fully configured, COPACOBANA hosts 120 low-cost FPGAs and is able to perform an exhaustive key search of DES at a rate of more than 235 keys per second, yielding an average search time of less than nine days. For this, we used the high-speed DES engine design of the Universite Catholique de Louvain's Crypto Group.

We provide a real-world example by giving an estimate of an attack with COPACOBANA against a formerly popular encryption tool (Norton Diskreet). Due to a cryptographical weak key derivation function it can be broken in very little time by applying a smart key search. As a further application, COPACOBANA can also be used to attack machine readable travel documents (ePass).

COPACOBANA is suitable for computational problems which are parallelizable and have low communication requirements. The hardware can be used, e.g., to attack elliptic curve cryptosystems and to factor numbers. COPACOBANA is intended to, but not necessarily restricted to solving problems related to cryptanalysis.

Fully configured, COPACOBANA hosts 120 low-cost FPGAs and is able to perform an exhaustive key search of DES at a rate of more than 235 keys per second, yielding an average search time of less than nine days. For this, we used the high-speed DES engine design of the Universite Catholique de Louvain's Crypto Group.

We provide a real-world example by giving an estimate of an attack with COPACOBANA against a formerly popular encryption tool (Norton Diskreet). Due to a cryptographical weak key derivation function it can be broken in very little time by applying a smart key search. As a further application, COPACOBANA can also be used to attack machine readable travel documents (ePass).

COPACOBANA is suitable for computational problems which are parallelizable and have low communication requirements. The hardware can be used, e.g., to attack elliptic curve cryptosystems and to factor numbers. COPACOBANA is intended to, but not necessarily restricted to solving problems related to cryptanalysis.

Abstract:

Cryptanalysis of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers is computationally extremely demanding. Since the security parameters of almost all practical crypto algorithms are chosen such that attacks with conventional computers are computationally infeasible, the only promising way to tackle existing ciphers (in the absence of mathematical breakthroughs) is to build special-purpose hardware. Dedicating those machines to the task of cryptanalysis holds the promise of a dramatically improved cost-performance ratio so that breaking of commercial ciphers comes within reach.

This contribution describes the design and realization of the reprogrammable machine COPACOBANA (Cost-Optimized Parallel Code Breaker), which is optimized for running cryptanalytical algorithms. The primary design goal was to produce a re-programmable low-cost design for less than BC 10,000 which is applicable for attacking the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in less than nine days.

Cryptanalysis of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers is computationally extremely demanding. Since the security parameters of almost all practical crypto algorithms are chosen such that attacks with conventional computers are computationally infeasible, the only promising way to tackle existing ciphers (in the absence of mathematical breakthroughs) is to build special-purpose hardware. Dedicating those machines to the task of cryptanalysis holds the promise of a dramatically improved cost-performance ratio so that breaking of commercial ciphers comes within reach.

This contribution describes the design and realization of the reprogrammable machine COPACOBANA (Cost-Optimized Parallel Code Breaker), which is optimized for running cryptanalytical algorithms. The primary design goal was to produce a re-programmable low-cost design for less than BC 10,000 which is applicable for attacking the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in less than nine days.

It will be shown that the architecture outperforms conventional computers by several orders of magnitude. Fully configured, COPACOBANA hosts 120 low-cost FPGAs and is able to perform an exhaustive key search of DES at a rate of more than 235 keys per second, yielding an average search time of less than nine days. For this, we used the high-speed DES engine design of the Universite Catholique de Louvain's Crypto Group.

We provide a real-world example by giving an estimate of an attack with COPACOBANA against a formerly popular encryption tool (Norton Diskreet). Due to a cryptographical weak key derivation function it can be broken in very little time by applying a smart key search. As a further application, COPACOBANA can also be used to attack machine readable travel documents (ePass).

COPACOBANA is suitable for computational problems which are parallelizable and have low communication requirements. The hardware can be used, e.g., to attack elliptic curve cryptosystems and to factor numbers. COPACOBANA is intended to, but not necessarily restricted to solving problems related to cryptanalysis.
